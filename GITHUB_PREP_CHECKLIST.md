# GitHub Upload Checklist

**Before uploading to GitHub, verify all private information has been removed.**

---

## ✅ Files Cleaned (Safe to Upload)

### Scripts
- [x] `scripts/deploy.js` - Addresses replaced with placeholders
- [x] `scripts/deploy-founders-vesting.js` - Addresses replaced with placeholders
- [x] `scripts/generate-vesting-txdata.js` - Addresses replaced with placeholders
- [x] `scripts/check-balance.js` - Addresses replaced with placeholders
- [x] `scripts/deploy-vesting.js` - Already had placeholders

### Documentation
- [x] `README.md` - Generic team info, no specific addresses
- [x] `DEPLOYMENT_RECORD.md` - Template with placeholders
- [x] `docs/EARLY_MEMBER_VESTING_GUIDE.md` - Template only
- [x] `docs/QUICKSWAP_LIQUIDITY_GUIDE.md` - Generic guide

### Configuration
- [x] `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- [x] `.gitignore` - Updated to exclude private files

---

## 🚨 Files NOT Safe to Upload (Excluded by .gitignore)

These files contain real addresses and should NOT be pushed to GitHub:

- ❌ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_COMPLETED.md` - Has real addresses
- ❌ `early-member-vesting-deployment.json` - Will have real addresses
- ❌ `.env` - Private keys

**These are automatically excluded by .gitignore** ✅

## 🔍 Final Verification Steps

### 1. Search for Real Addresses

Run this command to check for any remaining real addresses:

```bash
# Search for Ethereum addresses (excluding node_modules)
grep -r "0x[a-fA-F0-9]\{40\}" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git --exclude="*.json" .
```

**Expected results:** Should only find:
- Template addresses in docs
- Contract addresses in test files
- Zero addresses (0x0000...)
- Role hashes in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE

### 2. Check for Private Keys

```bash
# Make sure no private keys
grep -ri "private.*key" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git .
```

**Expected:** Should only find references in .env.example and documentation

### 3. Verify .env is Ignored

```bash
# .env should NOT appear in git status
git status
```

**Expected:** `.env` should NOT be listed (if it is, it's not being ignored!)

## 📤 Upload to GitHub

### Step 1: Initialize Git (if not already)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: PATH DAO Token"
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `path-dao-token`
3. Description: "Professional, secure, upgradeable ERC-20 governance token for PATH DAO"
4. Public or Private: **Public** (recommended for transparency)
5. Do NOT initialize with README (we have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/path-dao-token.git

# Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🎯 Post-Upload Tasks

### Update Repository Settings

1. **About Section:**
   - Description: "ERC-20 governance token for PATH DAO - Polygon mainnet"
   - Website: (your website)
   - Topics: `polygon`, `dao`, `governance-token`, `erc20`, `hardhat`, `openzeppelin`

2. **Add Topics:**
   - blockchain
   - ethereum
   - smart-contracts
   - defi
   - token
   - vesting

3. **Enable Issues** (for community feedback)

4. **Add LICENSE file:**
   - Recommended: MIT License
   - Or use your organization's license

### Create GitHub Releases

Tag your deployment:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial mainnet deployment"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Add Repository Badges (Optional)

Add to top of README.md:

```markdown
![Solidity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Solidity-0.8.27-blue)
![Network](https://img.shields.io/badge/Network-Polygon-purple)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)
```
