# PATH DAO - Final Tokenomics & Governance Plan

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** Pre-Mainnet Deployment
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

PATH DAO launches as an LLC-controlled organization that progressively decentralizes over 2-3 years. Revenue flows from subscriptions → courses/products → marketplace, with 30% directed to DAO treasury for buybacks, liquidity, and investments. Governance uses quadratic voting + contribution multipliers to prevent whale takeover while rewarding active participants.

**Key Numbers:**
- Total Supply: 100M PATH (hard cap)
- Year 1 Target: 1,000 members, $470k revenue
- Year 3 Target: 10,000 members, $5M+ revenue
- Price Targets: $0.30 (Year 1) → $10 (Year 5)

---

## 1. Liquidity Strategy

### Initial Deployment
- **Amount:** $100 USDC + 1,000 PATH
- **Platform:** QuickSwap (Polygon)
- **Initial Price:** $0.10/PATH
- **Rationale:** Conservative start, test market dynamics

### Growth Timeline

**Year 1: Bootstrap Phase**
- Month 1: $100 initial liquidity
- Months 2-6: Add 10% of DAO revenue monthly (~$100-1,500/mo)
- Months 7-12: Scale to $5-10k total liquidity
- **Target:** $25k total liquidity by end of Year 1

**Year 2-3: Scaling Phase**
- 10% of DAO treasury → liquidity additions
- Target: $100k liquidity by Year 2
- Target: $500k liquidity by Year 3

**Smart Contract Automation:**
```solidity
// Automated liquidity additions from treasury
function addLiquidityFromTreasury(uint256 pathAmount) external onlyRole(TREASURY_ROLE) {
    uint256 maxAllocation = (treasuryBalance * 10) / 100; // 10% cap
    require(pathAmount <= maxAllocation, "Exceeds liquidity allocation");

    // QuickSwap router integration
    router.addLiquidity(pathToken, usdcToken, pathAmount, usdcAmount, ...);
}
```

---

## 2. Treasury Allocation

**Revenue Split:**
- 70% → LLC operations
- 30% → DAO Treasury (on-chain)

**DAO Treasury Breakdown:**
| Allocation | % | Purpose | Smart Contract |
|------------|---|---------|----------------|
| Community Rewards | 50% | XP → PATH conversions | Automated via vesting |
| Buyback | 10% | Price support + burns | Automated buyback contract |
| Liquidity | 10% | DEX depth | QuickSwap integration |
| Investments | 20% | DeFi yield, partnerships | Multi-sig approval |
| Buffer | 10% | Emergency fund | Time-locked reserve |

**Year 1 Example:**
- Revenue: $470k
- DAO Treasury: $141k
- Rewards: $70.5k
- Buyback: $14.1k
- Liquidity: $14.1k
- Investments: $28.2k
- Buffer: $14.1k

---

## 3. Governance Model

### Guided Democracy (Years 1-2)

**Structure:**
- LLC proposes → DAO votes → LLC has veto power
- Veto exercised only for legal/existential risks
- Transparent veto reasoning required

**Voting Power Formula:**
```
Voting Power = √(PATH Holdings) × Contribution Multiplier

Where Contribution Multiplier = 1 + (XP Score / 10,000)
```

**Example:**
- Whale: 1M PATH, 0 XP = √1,000,000 = 1,000 votes
- Contributor: 10k PATH, 50k XP = √10,000 × 6 = 600 votes

**Transition to Full DAO (Year 3+):**
- Veto power sunsets
- DAO votes directly execute on-chain
- LLC retains only fiduciary/legal role

### Voting Mechanisms

**Proposal Types:**

1. **Minor Decisions** (< $10k impact)
   - Threshold: 10k PATH voting power
   - Duration: 3 days
   - Quorum: 5% of circulating supply

2. **Major Decisions** ($10k-100k impact)
   - Threshold: 50k PATH voting power
   - Duration: 7 days
   - Quorum: 10% of circulating supply

3. **Critical Decisions** (> $100k or governance changes)
   - Threshold: 100k PATH voting power
   - Duration: 14 days
   - Quorum: 20% of circulating supply
   - Requires 66% supermajority

**Platform:** Snapshot (gasless voting)

---

## 4. Token Distribution

### Allocation Breakdown

```
Total Supply: 100,000,000 PATH

├─ Treasury (37M, 37%)
│  └─ Operations, partnerships, strategic reserves
│
├─ Community Rewards (26M, 26%)
│  └─ XP-based distribution over 5 years
│
├─ Founders (22M, 22%)
│  ├─ Benjamin: 11M (6mo cliff, 4yr vest)
│  └─ David: 11M (6mo cliff, 4yr vest)
│
├─ Early Members (8M, 8%)
│  ├─ 20 members @ 400k each
│  └─ 1yr cliff, 3yr vest
│
└─ Liquidity Pool (7M, 7%)
   └─ QuickSwap PATH/USDC
```

### Circulating Supply Timeline

**Year 1:**
- Liquidity: 1k PATH (immediate)
- Vesting: 0 PATH (all in cliff)
- Rewards: 8.32M PATH (from community schedule)
- **Total Circulating:** ~8.3M (8.3%)

**Year 2:**
- Vesting starts releasing: ~550k/month
- Rewards: 6.24M PATH
- **Total Circulating:** ~21M (21%)

**Year 3:**
- Vesting: ~550k/month ongoing
- Rewards: 4.68M PATH
- **Total Circulating:** ~32M (32%)

**Year 5:**
- Founder vesting complete: 22M unlocked
- Most community rewards distributed
- **Total Circulating:** ~60M+ (60%+)

---

## 5. Community Rewards (XP → PATH)

### Annual Distribution Schedule

| Year | PATH Available | % of Rewards Pool |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 8,320,000 | 32% |
| 2 | 6,240,000 | 24% |
| 3 | 4,680,000 | 18% |
| 4 | 3,640,000 | 14% |
| 5 | 3,120,000 | 12% |
| **Total** | **26,000,000** | **100%** |

### Conversion Formula

```
Monthly PATH = (Your XP / Total DAO XP) × Population Factor × Monthly Tranche

Where:
- Population Factor = 0.1 + (0.9 × Active Members / Target Members)
- Monthly Tranche = Annual PATH / 12
```

**Example (Month 1, Year 1):**
- You earned: 5,000 XP
- Total DAO XP: 100,000 XP
- Active members: 20
- Target: 1,000
- Population factor: 0.1 + (0.9 × 20/1000) = 0.118
- Monthly tranche: 8,320,000 / 12 = 693,333 PATH
- **Your PATH:** (5,000/100,000) × 0.118 × 693,333 = 4,090 PATH

### Smart Contract Implementation

```solidity
contract PathRewards {
    mapping(address => uint256) public xpBalances;
    uint256 public totalXP;
    uint256 public currentYearTranche;

    function claimMonthlyRewards() external {
        uint256 userXP = xpBalances[msg.sender];
        uint256 userShare = (userXP * PRECISION) / totalXP;
        uint256 populationFactor = calculatePopulationFactor();
        uint256 monthlyTranche = currentYearTranche / 12;

        uint256 pathAmount = (userShare * populationFactor * monthlyTranche) / PRECISION;

        pathToken.mint(msg.sender, pathAmount);
        emit RewardsClaimed(msg.sender, pathAmount, userXP);
    }
}
```

---

## 6. Buyback & Price Support

### Strategy Overview

**Year 1: Buyback + Burn (dYdX Model)**
- Budget: $14,125 (10% of DAO treasury)
- Execution: Monthly, Months 7-12
- Method: QuickSwap market buys → Burn
- Expected: ~47k PATH burned at $0.30 avg

**Year 2+: Hybrid Approach (Sky Model)**
- 50% → Burn (deflationary pressure)
- 25% → Treasury hold (market making reserve)
- 25% → Add to LP (liquidity depth)

### Smart Contract Automation

```solidity
contract PathBuyback {
    IUniswapV2Router02 public quickswapRouter;
    address public pathToken;
    address public usdcToken;

    uint256 public constant BURN_ALLOCATION = 50; // 50%
    uint256 public constant TREASURY_ALLOCATION = 25; // 25%
    uint256 public constant LP_ALLOCATION = 25; // 25%

    function executeBuyback(uint256 usdcAmount) external onlyRole(TREASURY_ROLE) {
        // Swap USDC → PATH with 5% slippage protection
        address[] memory path = new address[](2);
        path[0] = usdcToken;
        path[1] = pathToken;

        uint256[] memory amounts = quickswapRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(
            usdcAmount,
            0, // Calculate min with 5% slippage
            path,
            address(this),
            block.timestamp + 300
        );

        uint256 pathBought = amounts[1];

        // Split allocation
        uint256 burnAmount = (pathBought * BURN_ALLOCATION) / 100;
        uint256 treasuryAmount = (pathBought * TREASURY_ALLOCATION) / 100;
        uint256 lpAmount = (pathBought * LP_ALLOCATION) / 100;

        // Execute splits
        IERC20(pathToken).burn(burnAmount);
        IERC20(pathToken).transfer(treasury, treasuryAmount);
        addToLiquidity(lpAmount);

        emit BuybackExecuted(usdcAmount, pathBought, burnAmount);
    }
}
```

### Expected Impact

**Price Support Mechanics:**

1. **Buying Pressure:** Consistent monthly buys create upward pressure
2. **Supply Reduction:** Burns decrease circulating supply (deflationary)
3. **Liquidity Depth:** LP additions reduce slippage for larger trades
4. **Market Making:** Treasury reserve allows strategic price defense

**Year 1 Projections:**
- Monthly buys: $1-3k
- PATH acquired: ~47k tokens
- Circulating supply reduction: 0.047%
- Psychological effect: "DAO backs its token"

**Year 3 Projections (at $5M revenue):**
- Annual buyback budget: $150k
- PATH acquired: ~50k-150k tokens (depending on price)
- Circulating supply reduction: 0.15-0.45%
- Compounding effect over years

---

## 7. DeFi Strategy

### Conservative Approach (Years 1-2)

**Primary: Aave Lending**
- Deploy 50% of treasury buffer to Aave
- Earn yield on USDC/MATIC
- Low risk, liquid, battle-tested

**Example:**
- Treasury buffer: $14k Year 1
- Aave deposit: $7k
- Expected APY: 3-5%
- Annual yield: $210-350

### Scaling Strategy (Year 2+)

**As treasury grows to $100k+:**

1. **Aave Lending (60%)**
   - Core stable yield
   - Maintains liquidity

2. **Uniswap V3 LP (30%)**
   - PATH/USDC concentrated liquidity
   - Tight ranges around target price
   - Earn trading fees

3. **Strategic Reserves (10%)**
   - Curve stable pools
   - Convex boosting
   - Other vetted protocols

**Risk Management:**
- Max 20% in any single protocol
- No leverage/borrowing
- Monthly risk reviews
- Community governance approval for new protocols

---

## 8. Membership & Revenue Model

### Tiered Pricing Structure

| Members | Price/Month | Revenue/Month |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 20 | $15 | $300 |
| 50 | $30 | $1,500 |
| 150 | $60 | $9,000 |
| 200 | $70 | $14,000 |
| 250 | $89 | $22,250 |
| 300+ | $99 | $29,700+ |

**Scaling Timeline:**
- Year 1: 20 → 1,000 members
- Year 3: 10,000 members
- Year 5: 50,000+ members

### Revenue Streams (Priority Order)

1. **Subscription Tiers** (Primary catalyst)
   - Community access
   - Basic resources
   - Discord/Guild.xyz gating

2. **Premium Products** (High margin)
   - Advanced courses
   - Certifications
   - 1-on-1 coaching
   - Software tools

3. **Marketplace** (Long-term)
   - Member-created courses
   - Community plugins/tools
   - PATH DAO takes 10-20% commission

**Revenue Flow:**
```
Total Revenue
├─ 70% → LLC (operations, growth, salaries)
└─ 30% → DAO Treasury (on-chain)
   ├─ 50% → Community rewards
   ├─ 10% → Buybacks
   ├─ 10% → Liquidity
   ├─ 20% → Investments
   └─ 10% → Buffer
```

### No PATH for Subscribers

**Rationale:**
- Avoid securities classification
- Keep token utility-focused (governance + rewards)
- Subscribers pay USD, contributors earn PATH
- Clear separation: money ≠ power, contribution = power

---

## 9. Decentralization Timeline

### Phase 1: LLC-Controlled (Months 1-12)

**Control:**
- LLC owns treasury multi-sig
- LLC executes all transactions
- DAO votes are advisory

**Why:**
- Legal clarity
- Rapid iteration
- Regulatory compliance
- Team learning governance

**Transparency:**
- All votes published
- Monthly treasury reports
- Open roadmap discussions

### Phase 2: Guided Democracy (Years 2-3)

**Control:**
- DAO proposes → votes → LLC executes
- LLC veto only for legal/existential risks
- Veto reasoning published within 48hrs

**Milestones:**
- 5,000 members
- $1M treasury
- Stable governance participation (>10% quorum consistently)

### Phase 3: Full DAO (Year 3+)

**Control:**
- On-chain governance executes directly
- LLC retains only fiduciary duties (taxes, legal compliance)
- Community elects operational leaders

**Requirements:**
- 10,000+ members
- Proven governance track record
- Legal structure finalized
- No existential risks

**Smart Contract Transition:**
```solidity
// Progressive decentralization timelock
contract GovernanceTimelock {
    uint256 public vetoExpirationTime;

    constructor() {
        vetoExpirationTime = block.timestamp + 730 days; // 2 years
    }

    function executeProposal(bytes calldata data) external {
        if (block.timestamp < vetoExpirationTime) {
            require(msg.sender == llcMultisig, "LLC approval required");
        } else {
            require(msg.sender == daoGovernor, "DAO Governor only");
        }

        (bool success,) = target.call(data);
        require(success, "Execution failed");
    }
}
```

---

## 10. Legal Structure

### Simple LLC Approach

**Entity:**
- PATH DAO LLC (Delaware or Wyoming)
- Founders as members
- Standard operating agreement

**Why Simple:**
- Avoid DAO LLC complexity
- Clear tax treatment
- No K-1s for token holders
- Faster setup, lower costs

**Separation:**
- LLC = Legal owner (bank accounts, contracts, IP)
- DAO = Governance layer (votes, proposals, treasury)
- PATH Token = Utility + governance rights (not ownership)

**Member Rights vs Token Rights:**

| Right | LLC Members | PATH Holders |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Profits | ✅ Dividends | ❌ No dividends |
| Voting | ❌ No vote | ✅ Governance vote |
| Tax | K-1 for members | Capital gains only |
| Liability | Protected by LLC | No liability |
| Ownership | Legal ownership | No ownership claim |

**Securities Compliance:**
- PATH is utility token (governance + rewards)
- No profit sharing
- No investment expectation messaging
- Earned through contribution, not purchased for profit
- Howey Test: Fails "expectation of profits from others' efforts"

---

## 11. Community Roles & Leadership

### Appointed Roles (Year 1)

**Structure:**
- LLC appoints initial roles
- 3-month terms
- Community feedback considered

**Key Roles:**
- Community Manager
- Content Lead
- Technical Lead
- Governance Facilitator

**Compensation:**
- XP bonuses (2x-5x multipliers)
- PATH stipends from treasury
- Revenue share for content creators

### Elected + Appointed (Year 2)

**Transition:**
- 50% appointed by LLC
- 50% elected by DAO
- Elections every 6 months

**Voting:**
- Quadratic + contribution multiplier
- Nomination threshold: 5k PATH
- Campaign period: 2 weeks

### Fully Elected (Year 3+)

**Structure:**
- All operational roles elected
- DAO votes on compensation
- Term limits: 2 consecutive terms max

**Potential Bicameral Model:**

*House of Contributors (Lower House):*
- Elected by all PATH holders
- Quadratic + contribution voting
- Focuses on: Operations, rewards, small spending

*Senate (Upper House):*
- Elected by top 10% contributors (XP-based)
- Weighted by contribution score
- Focuses on: Governance changes, large spending, strategic direction

**Why Bicameral:**
- Prevents populism in critical decisions
- Rewards serious contributors
- Checks and balances
- Mirrors real-world governance success

**Implementation (Future):**
```solidity
contract BicameralGovernor {
    enum ProposalType { OPERATIONAL, CRITICAL }

    function propose(ProposalType pType, ...) external {
        if (pType == ProposalType.OPERATIONAL) {
            // Only House votes
            require(hasHouseVotingPower(msg.sender), "Insufficient voting power");
        } else {
            // Both House and Senate must pass
            require(hasHouseVotingPower(msg.sender), "Insufficient voting power");
            proposals[id].requiresSenate = true;
        }
    }

    function execute(uint256 proposalId) external {
        Proposal storage prop = proposals[proposalId];

        if (prop.requiresSenate) {
            require(prop.houseApproved && prop.senateApproved, "Both houses must approve");
        } else {
            require(prop.houseApproved, "House must approve");
        }

        // Execute...
    }
}
```

## 13. Founder Vesting

### Current Terms (Keep As-Is)

**Benjamin Curatto:**
- Amount: 11,000,000 PATH
- Cliff: 6 months
- Vesting: 48 months linear (4 years)
- Start: Token deployment date

**David Hepting:**
- Amount: 11,000,000 PATH
- Cliff: 6 months
- Vesting: 48 months linear (4 years)
- Start: Token deployment date

**Claiming:**
- Self-service via vesting contract
- Call `claim()` anytime after cliff
- Automatic pro-rata calculation
- Gas paid by claimant

**Example Timeline:**
```
Month 0: Deploy, 0 claimable
Month 6: Cliff ends, 1.375M claimable (6/48 * 11M)
Month 12: 2.75M total claimable
Month 24: 5.5M total claimable
Month 48: 11M fully vested
Month 54: All vested tokens claimed
```

**Smart Contract:**
```solidity
// Already implemented in PATHVesting.sol
function claimableAmount(address beneficiary) public view returns (uint256) {
    VestingSchedule memory schedule = vestingSchedules[beneficiary];

    if (block.timestamp < schedule.startTime + schedule.cliffDuration) {
        return 0; // Still in cliff
    }

    uint256 timeAfterCliff = block.timestamp - (schedule.startTime + schedule.cliffDuration);
    uint256 vestedAmount = (schedule.totalAmount * timeAfterCliff) / schedule.vestingDuration;

    return vestedAmount - schedule.amountClaimed;
}
```

---

## 14. Early Member Distribution

### Equal Distribution Model

**Allocation:**
- Total: 8,000,000 PATH
- Members: 20 early supporters
- Per member: 400,000 PATH

**Vesting Terms:**
- Cliff: 12 months
- Vesting: 36 months linear (3 years)
- Start: When member joins/vests

**Eligibility:**
- Defined by founders pre-launch
- Could be: first course takers, alpha testers, initial Discord members
- Locked in before mainnet deployment

**Implementation:**
```solidity
// Deploy one vesting contract per early member
for (uint i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    address member = earlyMembers[i];
    PATHVesting vesting = new PATHVesting(pathToken);

    pathToken.transfer(address(vesting), 400_000 * 10**18);

    vesting.createVestingSchedule(
        member,
        400_000 * 10**18,
        block.timestamp,
        12, // 12 month cliff
        36  // 36 month vesting
    );
}
```

**Alternative: Single Contract**
```solidity
// More gas efficient: one contract, multiple schedules
PATHVesting earlyMemberVesting = new PATHVesting(pathToken);
pathToken.transfer(address(earlyMemberVesting), 8_000_000 * 10**18);

for (uint i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    earlyMemberVesting.createVestingSchedule(
        earlyMembers[i],
        400_000 * 10**18,
        block.timestamp,
        12,
        36
    );
}
```

---

## 15. Price Targets & Expectations

### Conservative Projections

**Year 1: $0.30**
- Target members: 1,000
- Circulating supply: 8.3M PATH
- Market cap: $2.49M
- Liquidity: $25k
- **Price drivers:** Early adopter demand, limited supply, buyback pressure

**Year 3: $1-3**
- Target members: 10,000
- Circulating supply: 32M PATH
- Market cap: $32-96M
- Liquidity: $500k
- **Price drivers:** Product-market fit, sustainable revenue, DeFi integrations

**Year 5: $10**
- Target members: 50,000+
- Circulating supply: 60M PATH
- Market cap: $600M
- Liquidity: $5M+
- **Price drivers:** Market leader positioning, full decentralization, ecosystem growth

### Factors Influencing Price

**Positive:**
- Monthly buyback pressure
- Deflationary burns
- Limited circulating supply (vesting locks)
- Revenue growth → treasury growth → more buybacks
- Community engagement → governance value
- DeFi integrations (lending, LP incentives)

**Negative:**
- Vesting unlocks (gradual sell pressure)
- Market conditions (bear markets)
- Competition from other education DAOs
- Regulatory uncertainty
- Low initial liquidity (high volatility)

### No Price Promises

**Legal Disclaimer:**
- These are internal planning targets, NOT promises
- PATH is utility token for governance + rewards
- Price is determined by market, not guaranteed
- Focus messaging on: utility, community, contribution

**Marketing Language:**
- ✅ "Earn PATH by contributing to the DAO"
- ✅ "PATH holders govern the community"
- ✅ "Limited supply with deflationary mechanics"
- ❌ "PATH will reach $10" (security risk)
- ❌ "Buy PATH as an investment" (security risk)
- ❌ "PATH token sale" (security risk)

- Year 2: 5-10% (product-market fit)
- Year 3+: 3-5% (sticky community)

**Growth Model:**
```
Net Growth = New Members - (Existing Members × Churn Rate)

Example Year 1:
- Start: 20 members
- New/month avg: 82
- Churn: 10%
- End: 1,000 members

Month 6 example:
- Existing: 150
- New: 80
- Churned: 150 × 10% = 15
- Net: 150 + 80 - 15 = 215
```

**Year 5: 30% Subscriptions, 35% Courses, 35% Marketplace**
- Mature ecosystem
- Marketplace generates passive income
- Platform fees become significant

### Revenue Projections

| Year | Members | Subscription | Courses | Marketplace | Total |
|------|---------|--------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | 1,000 | $470k | $88k | $29k | $587k |
| 2 | 3,000 | $2.1M | $1.05M | $350k | $3.5M |
| 3 | 10,000 | $4.8M | $4.8M | $2.4M | $12M |
| 5 | 50,000 | $18M | $21M | $21M | $60M |

**Assumptions:**
- Subscription ARPU: $39-47/mo avg (weighted by tier)
- Course sales: ~20% of members buy 1-2 courses/year @ $200 avg
- Marketplace: 10% commission on growing transaction volume

## 18. Exit Strategy

### Hybrid Approach

**Options Over Time:**

1. **Bootstrap Forever (40% probability)**
   - DAO becomes self-sustaining
   - Founders transition to advisor roles
   - Community fully governs
   - Founders' vested PATH = compensation
   - No external sale

2. **Acquisition (30% probability)**
   - Larger ed-tech platform buys LLC
   - PATH token remains independent
   - Community governance continues
   - Founders exit via LLC sale
   - Example: Coursera acquires PATH DAO's IP/courses

3. **Token Event (20% probability)**
   - Major CEX listing (Coinbase, Binance)
   - Provides founder liquidity via vested tokens
   - Community benefits from liquidity
   - DAO continues operating
   - Example: Uniswap model

4. **Hybrid Exit (10% probability)**
   - LLC acquired by strategic partner
   - DAO spins out as independent entity
   - Token continues on new chain/ecosystem
   - Example: ConstitutionDAO → spin-offs

### Founder Alignment

**Vesting ensures:**
- 4.5 year commitment minimum
- Success = rising PATH price
- Exit doesn't harm community
- Gradual, not sudden, liquidity

**Never:**
- Rug pull (vesting prevents)
- Dump tokens (would tank price, hurt selves)
- Abandon DAO (reputation + vested tokens at stake)

**Transparency:**
- Annual "State of the DAO" addresses
- Open discussions about long-term vision
- Community input on major pivots

## 19. Risk Mitigation

### Smart Contract Risks

**Mitigations:**
- OpenZeppelin audited contracts
- UUPS upgradeability (fix bugs without migration)
- Pausable (emergency stop)
- Role-based access control (limit attack surface)
- Multi-sig for all critical functions

**Ongoing:**
- Annual security audits (as budget allows)
- Bug bounty program (Year 2+)
- Community code reviews

### Regulatory Risks

**Mitigations:**
- Legal counsel review before launch
- No profit-sharing (avoid security classification)
- Clear utility (governance + rewards)
- KYC for large transactions (if needed)
- Jurisdiction selection (friendly states)

**Monitoring:**
- Track SEC guidance on DAOs
- Adapt governance if needed
- Prepared to register if required

### Market Risks

**Mitigations:**
- Conservative liquidity strategy (avoid impermanent loss)
- Diversified revenue (not token-dependent)
- Treasury reserves (10% buffer)
- No leverage/risky DeFi
- Stablecoin focus (USDC, not volatile assets)

**Scenarios:**
- Bear market: DAO continues operating on subscription revenue
- PATH price crashes: Buybacks accelerate, acquire tokens cheaply
- Liquidity drain: Treasury can add liquidity or pause trading

### Governance Risks

**Mitigations:**
- Quadratic voting (prevent whale takeover)
- Contribution multipliers (reward active participants)
- Time delays on critical proposals (prevent rushed decisions)
- Veto power during transition (prevent existential mistakes)
- Quorum requirements (prevent low-turnout manipulation)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sybil attack: Contribution multiplier makes it expensive
- Vote buying: Delegation tracked, large swings flagged
- Governance capture: Bicameral system (future) provides checks

### Operational Risks

**Mitigations:**
- LLC provides legal stability
- Multi-sig prevents single point of failure
- Distributed team (not dependent on one person)
- Documentation (knowledge not siloed)
- Succession planning for key roles

## Conclusion

This plan provides a clear path from LLC-controlled launch to fully decentralized DAO. Key principles:

1. **Progressive decentralization** - Earn trust before giving power
2. **Revenue-first** - DAO sustainability through products, not token sales
3. **Contribution > capital** - Quadratic voting + XP rewards active participants
4. **Transparency** - All decisions, votes, and treasury movements public
5. **Long-term alignment** - Founder vesting ensures 4+ year commitment
6. **Smart contract automation** - Reduce trust, increase efficiency
7. **Legal clarity** - LLC separation avoids securities issues
8. **Price support** - Buybacks + burns create sustainable tokenomics

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Complete pre-deployment checklist
3. Deploy to Polygon mainnet
4. Execute Week 1-2 distribution
5. Launch community and governance
6. Iterate based on feedback

**Living Document:**
This plan will evolve. Expect quarterly updates as we learn from the community and market. Major changes require DAO governance approval.
