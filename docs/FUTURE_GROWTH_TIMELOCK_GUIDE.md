# Future Growth Timelock - Deployment Guide

**Purpose:** Lock 10M PATH for 2 years for "resources for sustainable operations"

**Unlock:** Requires community governance vote after 2-year period

**Amount:** 10,000,000 PATH

---

## 🎯 Overview

Based on your token distribution image, you have:

```
Future Growth: 10,000,000 PATH (10%)
- Lock Duration: 2 years
- Purpose: Operations, buybacks, benefits, liquidity
- Release: Community vote required
```

This timelock ensures:
- ✅ **Commitment** - Tokens can't be used immediately
- ✅ **Transparency** - On-chain lock visible to everyone
- ✅ **Community Control** - DAO votes on release after 2 years
- ✅ **Flexibility** - Can be used for any approved purpose once unlocked

---

## 📋 What is the Future Growth Allocation For?

According to your plan, these 10M PATH can be used for:

### Potential Uses (After Community Vote):

1. **Sustainable Operations**
   - Extend runway if subscription growth slows
   - Fund new product development
   - Hire additional team members

2. **Buybacks & Benefits**
   - Additional buyback budget beyond 10% allocation
   - Strategic market support during bear markets
   - Member benefit programs

3. **Liquidity Expansion**
   - Add to QuickSwap pool if needed
   - Provide liquidity on additional DEXs
   - CEX listing liquidity requirements

4. **Community Rewards**
   - Additional XP → PATH rewards if demand exceeds 26M allocation
   - Special programs/contests
   - Ambassador/contributor bonuses

5. **Strategic Partnerships**
   - Integration incentives with other protocols
   - Co-marketing token swaps
   - Ecosystem growth initiatives

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Timelock Contract

Create deployment script: `scripts/deploy-future-growth-timelock.js`

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  console.log("═══════════════════════════════════════════════════");
  console.log("  DEPLOYING FUTURE GROWTH TIMELOCK");
  console.log("═══════════════════════════════════════════════════\n");

  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
  console.log("Deploying with account:", deployer.address);
  console.log("Account balance:", ethers.formatEther(await ethers.provider.getBalance(deployer.address)), "POL\n");

  // ADDRESSES - UPDATE THESE!
  const PATH_TOKEN = "YOUR_PATH_TOKEN_ADDRESS"; // From main deployment
  const TREASURY_SAFE = "YOUR_TREASURY_SAFE_ADDRESS";

  const FUTURE_GROWTH_AMOUNT = ethers.parseEther("10000000"); // 10M PATH

  console.log("📋 Configuration:");
  console.log("PATH Token:", PATH_TOKEN);
  console.log("Treasury Safe (Owner):", TREASURY_SAFE);
  console.log("Lock Amount:", ethers.formatEther(FUTURE_GROWTH_AMOUNT), "PATH");
  console.log("Lock Duration: 2 years (730 days)\n");

  // Deploy timelock
  console.log("🚀 Deploying PATHTimelock...");
  const PATHTimelock = await ethers.getContractFactory("PATHTimelock");
  const timelock = await PATHTimelock.deploy(PATH_TOKEN);
  await timelock.waitForDeployment();
  const timelockAddress = await timelock.getAddress();

  console.log("✅ Timelock deployed:", timelockAddress, "\n");

  // Get unlock time
  const unlockTime = await timelock.unlockTime();
  const unlockDate = new Date(Number(unlockTime) * 1000);

  console.log("⏰ Lock Details:");
  console.log("  Start Time:", new Date().toLocaleString());
  console.log("  Unlock Time:", unlockDate.toLocaleString());
  console.log("  Days Locked:", 730, "days (2 years)\n");

  // Transfer ownership to Treasury Safe
  console.log("🔐 Transferring ownership to Treasury Safe...");
  const transferTx = await timelock.transferOwnership(TREASURY_SAFE);
  await transferTx.wait();
  console.log("✅ Ownership transferred to:", TREASURY_SAFE, "\n");

  console.log("═══════════════════════════════════════════════════");
  console.log("  DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE ✅");
  console.log("═══════════════════════════════════════════════════\n");

  console.log("📋 TIMELOCK CONTRACT:");
  console.log("Address:", timelockAddress);
  console.log("Owner:", TREASURY_SAFE);
  console.log("Unlock Date:", unlockDate.toLocaleDateString());

  console.log("\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════");
  console.log("  NEXT STEPS - EXECUTE FROM GNOSIS SAFE");
  console.log("═══════════════════════════════════════════════════\n");

  console.log("Go to: https://app.safe.global");
  console.log("Connect to Treasury Safe:", TREASURY_SAFE);

  console.log("\n📤 TRANSFER TOKENS TO TIMELOCK\n");
  console.log("Transaction: Transfer to Future Growth Timelock");
  console.log("  To:", timelockAddress);
  console.log("  Contract:", PATH_TOKEN);
  console.log("  Function: transfer");
  console.log("  Parameters:");
  console.log("    - to:", timelockAddress);
  console.log("    - amount:", FUTURE_GROWTH_AMOUNT.toString(), "(10000000000000000000000000)");

  console.log("\n✅ After transfer, 10M PATH will be locked until:", unlockDate.toLocaleDateString());
  console.log("\n🗳️  To unlock: Community governance vote required on Snapshot\n");

  console.log("═══════════════════════════════════════════════════");
  console.log("  ✅ FUTURE GROWTH TIMELOCK SETUP COMPLETE");
  console.log("═══════════════════════════════════════════════════\n");
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

**Run:**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-future-growth-timelock.js --network polygon
```

**Expected Cost:** ~0.02 POL

---

### Step 2: Verify Contract on PolygonScan

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network polygon <TIMELOCK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <PATH_TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

---

### Step 3: Transfer 10M PATH to Timelock

From **Treasury Safe** on https://app.safe.global:

**Transaction:**
```
To: [PATH Token Address]
Function: transfer
Parameters:
  - to: [Timelock Contract Address]
  - amount: 10000000000000000000000000 (10M PATH)
```

---

## 🔍 Verification

After transfer, verify on PolygonScan:

**Check Timelock Balance:**
1. Go to: `https://polygonscan.com/address/[TIMELOCK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS]`
2. Click "Token" tab
3. Verify: 10,000,000 PATH

**Check Unlock Time:**
1. Click "Read Contract"
2. Call `unlockTime()`
3. Convert timestamp to date (should be ~2 years from now)
4. Call `isUnlocked()` → Should return `false`
5. Call `getLockedBalance()` → Should return 10,000,000 PATH

---

## ⏰ After 2 Years: Unlock Process

### When Lock Expires (2 years from deployment):

1. **Community Governance Vote (Snapshot)**
   - Proposal: "Release Future Growth allocation"
   - Options:
     - Release for [specific purpose]
     - Keep locked for another period
     - Release in tranches
   - Duration: 7-14 days
   - Quorum: 20% (critical decision)
   - Threshold: 66% supermajority

2. **If Vote Passes:**
   ```javascript
   // From Treasury Safe
   Timelock.withdraw(recipient_address)
   ```
   - `recipient_address` can be:
     - Treasury Safe (most common)
     - Buyback contract
     - Rewards contract
     - Community Safe
     - Specific program address

3. **Tokens Released**
   - One-time withdrawal
   - All 10M PATH sent to recipient
   - Timelock contract becomes empty

---

## 📊 Current Token Distribution (After Timelock)

```
Total Supply: 100,000,000 PATH

Distribution:
├── Treasury Safe: 42,000,000 PATH (42%) - LIQUID ✅
├── Community Safe: 26,000,000 PATH (26%) - LIQUID ✅
├── Benjamin Vesting: 11,000,000 PATH (11%) - LOCKED (6mo cliff, 4yr vest) 🔒
├── David Vesting: 11,000,000 PATH (11%) - LOCKED (6mo cliff, 4yr vest) 🔒
├── Future Growth Timelock: 10,000,000 PATH (10%) - LOCKED (2yr, DAO vote) 🔒
└── Liquidity Pool: 1,000 PATH (0.001%) - LIQUID ✅

Liquid: 68,001,000 PATH (68%)
Locked: 32,000,000 PATH (32%)
```

**Note:** Treasury still has 42M PATH liquid for:
- Early member vesting: 8M PATH (10 members @ 800K each)
- Additional liquidity: As needed
- Strategic reserves: 34M PATH

## 🔐 Security Features

### Timelock Contract:

✅ **Immutable Lock Duration** - Can't be changed after deployment
✅ **Owner-Only Withdrawal** - Only Treasury Safe can withdraw
✅ **Time-Based Release** - Enforced by block.timestamp
✅ **Single Withdrawal** - Can only withdraw once
✅ **Transparent** - All on-chain, publicly verifiable

### No Backdoors:

❌ **No early unlock** - Must wait full 2 years
❌ **No emergency withdraw** - Tokens truly locked
❌ **No upgrade** - Contract is not upgradeable
❌ **No ownership change** - Owned by immutable Treasury Safe

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Community Expectations:

When you announce this timelock:

✅ **Be transparent** - Explain it's for sustainable operations
✅ **Show commitment** - 2-year lock demonstrates long-term thinking
✅ **Promise governance** - Community will decide how to use it
✅ **Update regularly** - Annual reports on why it's still needed

### Don't:

❌ Promise specific uses (wait for DAO vote)
❌ Unlock early (community will lose trust)
❌ Use without governance (defeats the purpose)

## 📊 Comparison with Other Allocations

| Allocation | Amount | Lock Type | Duration | Control |
|------------|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Treasury | 42M | None | Immediate | Treasury Safe |
| Community | 26M | None | Immediate | Community Safe |
| Founders | 22M | Vesting | 4.5 yrs | Immutable |
| Future Growth | 10M | Timelock | 2 yrs → DAO | DAO Vote |
| Liquidity | 1K+ | None | Dynamic | Treasury Safe |

**Future Growth is unique:**
- Long enough to show commitment
- Short enough to be useful (vs founder 4.5yr vest)
- Requires governance (most democratic)
- Flexible purpose (adapts to DAO needs)
