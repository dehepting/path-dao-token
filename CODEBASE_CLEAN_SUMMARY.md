# ✅ Codebase Cleaned for GitHub Upload

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Status:** READY FOR PUBLIC UPLOAD 🎉

---

## 🧹 Cleaning Actions Completed

### 1. Scripts Cleaned ✅
- ✅ `scripts/deploy.js` - Placeholder addresses
- ✅ `scripts/deploy-founders-vesting.js` - Placeholder addresses
- ✅ `scripts/deploy-vesting.js` - Placeholder addresses
- ✅ `scripts/check-balance.js` - Placeholder addresses
- ✅ `scripts/generate-vesting-txdata.js` - Placeholder addresses
- ✅ `scripts/utils/` - **DELETED** (testnet-specific)

### 2. Documentation Cleaned ✅
- ✅ `docs/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` - Placeholders instead of real addresses
- ✅ `docs/EARLY_MEMBER_VESTING_GUIDE.md` - Placeholders instead of real addresses
- ✅ `docs/QUICKSWAP_LIQUIDITY_GUIDE.md` - Generic addresses only
- ✅ `docs/mainnet-readiness-report.md` - **DELETED** (had testnet addresses)

### 3. Files Added to .gitignore ✅
```
DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_COMPLETED.md
early-member-vesting-deployment.json
PRIVACY_AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

These files contain real mainnet deployment info and will NOT be uploaded.

## 🔒 Privacy Protection Summary

### What's Protected (NOT in GitHub):
- ✅ Treasury Safe address
- ✅ Community Safe address
- ✅ Benjamin's wallet address
- ✅ David's wallet address
- ✅ Real vesting contract addresses
- ✅ Private keys (.env file)
- ✅ Actual deployment transaction hashes

### What's Public (Safe):
- ✅ Smart contract source code
- ✅ Deployment scripts with placeholders
- ✅ Tests with test addresses
- ✅ Documentation with examples
- ✅ QuickSwap public contract addresses
- ✅ USDC/WMATIC standard token addresses

---

## 📋 Final Verification

### Ran These Scans:

```bash
# 1. Scan for real mainnet addresses
grep -r "0x325e71d4Ca1dB3b5DAdfe819320aBc6975827D36\|..." \
  --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git \
  --exclude-dir=artifacts --include="*.js" --include="*.md"
```
**Result:** ✅ No matches (all excluded or cleaned)

```bash
# 2. Verify .gitignore working
git status | grep "DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_COMPLETED\|.env"
```
**Result:** ✅ Files properly ignored
